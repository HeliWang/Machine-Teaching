# Machine Teaching
A web application for training supervised models with feedback.

# FAQ

## What is this?

Lots of open-source projects exist for machine learning _algorithms_, but most of the value comes from the _training data_.
Especially in applications of NLP, out-of-the-box systems don't work very well on _your_ data. Machine Teaching exists to make
it easier to create _your own_ training sets to feed into those algorithms.

## What kinds of data does this application work with?

We primarily focus on document tagging and sequence tagging tasks, but also have an eye on image classification in the future.
